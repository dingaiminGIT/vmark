# Export & Print

VMark provides multiple ways to export and share your documents.

## Export Modes

### Folder Mode (Default)

Creates a self-contained folder with clean structure:

```
MyDocument/
├── index.html
└── assets/
    ├── image1.png
    ├── image2.jpg
    └── ...
```

**Benefits:**
- Clean URLs when served (`/MyDocument/` instead of `/MyDocument.html`)
- Easy to share as a single folder
- Simple asset paths (`assets/image.png`)
- Works great with static site hosts

### Single File Mode

Creates a single self-contained HTML file:

```
MyDocument.html
```

All images are embedded as data URIs, making it completely portable but larger in file size.

## How to Export

### Export HTML

1. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + E` or use **File → Export HTML**
2. Choose export location
3. For folder mode: Enter folder name (e.g., `MyDocument`)
4. For single mode: Enter filename with `.html` extension

### Print / Export PDF

1. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + P` or use **File → Print**
2. Use the system print dialog to print or save as PDF

### Copy as HTML

Press `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + C` to copy the rendered HTML to clipboard for pasting into other applications.

## VMark Reader

When you export to HTML (styled mode), your document includes the **VMark Reader** — an interactive reading experience with powerful features.

### Settings Panel

Click the gear icon (bottom-right) or press `Esc` to open the settings panel:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Font Size | Adjust text size (12px – 24px) |
| Line Height | Adjust line spacing (1.2 – 2.0) |
| Light/Dark Theme | Toggle between light and dark mode |
| CJK-Latin Spacing | Toggle spacing between CJK and Latin characters |

### Table of Contents

The TOC sidebar helps navigate long documents:

- **Toggle**: Click the panel header or press `T`
- **Navigate**: Click any heading to jump to it
- **Keyboard**: Use `↑`/`↓` arrows to move, `Enter` to jump
- **Highlight**: Current section is highlighted as you scroll

### Reading Progress

A subtle progress bar at the top of the page shows how far you've read through the document.

### Back to Top

A floating button appears when you scroll down. Click it or press `Home` to return to the top.

### Image Lightbox

Click any image to view it in a full-screen lightbox:

- **Close**: Click outside, press `Esc`, or click the X button
- **Navigate**: Use `←`/`→` arrows for multiple images
- **Zoom**: Images display at their natural size

### Code Blocks

Each code block includes interactive controls:

| Button | Function |
|--------|----------|
| Line numbers toggle | Show/hide line numbers for this block |
| Copy button | Copy code to clipboard |

The copy button shows a checkmark when successful.

### Footnote Navigation

Footnotes are fully interactive:

- Click a footnote reference `[1]` to jump to its definition
- Click the `↩` backref to return to where you were reading

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|

| `T` | Toggle Table of Contents |
| `↑` / `↓` | Navigate TOC items |
| `Enter` | Jump to selected TOC item |

| `Home` | Scroll to top |

## Export Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Export HTML | `Alt + Mod + E` |
| Print | `Mod + P` |
| Copy as HTML | `Mod + Shift + C` |

## Tips

### Serving Exported HTML

The folder export structure works well with any static file server:

```bash
# Python
cd MyDocument && python -m http.server 8000

# Node.js (npx)
npx serve MyDocument

# Open directly
open MyDocument/index.html
```

### Offline Viewing

Both export modes work completely offline:

- **Folder mode**: Open `index.html` in any browser
- **Single mode**: Open the `.html` file directly

Math equations (KaTeX) require an internet connection for the stylesheet, but all other content works offline.

### Best Practices

1. **Use folder mode** for documents you'll share or host
2. **Use single mode** for quick sharing via email or chat
3. **Include descriptive image alt text** for accessibility
4. **Test the exported HTML** in different browsers
