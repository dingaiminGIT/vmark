# Integrated Terminal

VMark includes a built-in terminal panel so you can run commands without leaving the editor.

Press `` Ctrl + ` `` to toggle the terminal panel.

## Sessions

The terminal supports up to 5 concurrent sessions, each with its own shell process. A vertical tab bar on the right side shows numbered session tabs.

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| New session | Click the **+** button |
| Switch session | Click a tab number |
| Close session | Click the trash icon |
| Restart shell | Click the restart icon |

When you close the last session the panel hides but the session stays alive — reopen with `` Ctrl + ` `` and you are back where you left off. If a shell process exits, press any key to restart it.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

These shortcuts work when the terminal panel is focused:

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Copy | `Mod + C` (with selection) |
| Paste | `Mod + V` |
| Clear | `Mod + K` |
| Search | `Mod + F` |
| Toggle Terminal | `` Ctrl + ` `` |

::: tip
`Mod + C` without a text selection sends SIGINT to the running process — the same as pressing Ctrl+C in a regular terminal.
:::

## Search

Press `Mod + F` to open the search bar. Type to search incrementally through the terminal buffer.

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| Next match | `Enter` |
| Previous match | `Shift + Enter` |
| Close search | `Escape` |

## Context Menu

Right-click inside the terminal to access:

- **Copy** — copy selected text (disabled when nothing is selected)
- **Paste** — paste from clipboard into the shell
- **Select All** — select the entire terminal buffer
- **Clear** — clear visible output

## Clickable Links

The terminal detects two kinds of links in command output:

- **Web URLs** — click to open in your default browser
- **File paths** — click to open the file in the editor (supports `:line:col` suffixes and relative paths resolved against the workspace root)

## Shell Environment

VMark sets these environment variables in every terminal session:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `TERM_PROGRAM` | `vmark` |
| `EDITOR` | `vmark` |
| `VMARK_WORKSPACE` | Workspace root path (when a folder is open) |

The shell is read from `$SHELL` (falls back to `/bin/sh`). The working directory starts at the workspace root, or the active file's parent directory, or `$HOME`.

When you open a workspace or file after the terminal is already running, all sessions automatically `cd` to the new workspace root.

## Settings

Open **Settings → Terminal** to configure:

| Setting | Range | Default |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Font Size | 10 – 24 px | 13 px |
| Line Height | 1.0 – 2.0 | 1.4 |
| Copy on Select | On / Off | On |

Changes apply immediately to all open sessions.

## Persistence

Terminal panel visibility and height are saved and restored across hot-exit restarts. Shell processes themselves cannot be preserved — a fresh shell is spawned for each session on restart.
